                        A red truck pulls up to the house. The engine turns off. Everything is sits still for several seconds. 
                        We hear the wind blow clearly, but quietly.

                        A blue car drives quickly down the highway. We see a Florida state sticker on the back window as the car passes a sign that says "Welcome to Woodstock, Alabama!"
                        A highway sign on the other side of the road reads: "Montgomery 85 mi."

                        Finally, a taller-than-average man steps out. This is Tyler Goodson. He's young - in his twenties - but he looks older than usual today. 
                        He's wearing a tank top and we see his arms are covered in tattoos. His face is smooth and round until it's interrupted by his curly brown beard.
                        Tyler walks towards the front door. As he approaches the entrance, he pulls a keychain from his pocket.
                        He steps up to the door and pauses. He closes his eyes, breathes deeply, and unlocks the door.

                    <p>
                        We see an older couple, a Reta and Charlie Lawrence, in the car. Reta is driving and Charlie is sitting in the passenger seat. 
                        Reta's face is heavier than can be explained by the long drive; she has bags under her eyes and she's slouching forward. 
                        Charlie sits stiff and straight. He has a detached look as he gazes out of the passenger side window.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The car pulls into a parking lot. The nearest building has a sign that reads "Bibb County Sheriff's Office"

                    <p>Tyler goes around the empty house doing various chores:</p>

                        Reta is standing in the driveway pacing back and forth. Occaisonally, as a car passes on the nearby road, Reta will look up before,
                        and then return to her pacing.
